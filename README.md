Hello everyone ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ

I will be attempting to create a card game called War â™ â™£â™¥â™¦.

The game will require a deck containing 52 cards, divided into 4 suits [â™ , â™£, â™¥, â™¦]. Each suit will have 13 cards: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A].

The deck should be shuffled randomly.

After shuffling, the deck is split equally among the players.

Game Rules:

A lower-ranked card can only be played on a card of the same suit.
A higher-ranked card can overtake a lower-ranked card of the same suit.
If a player cannot play the same suit or overtake the current card, they must take all the played cards into their hand.
